# Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for MNIST Classification
Building MNIST Classifier with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations using TorchDyn library. Neural ODE layer is trained to find vector field to separate different classes. I think NODEs are very interesting application of neural networks.
