# deep-learning-in-pytorch
This repository contains code for my projects made using PyTorch


## Models:
- [Cycle GAN](cycle_gan/)
    - Implementation of Cycle GAN architecture.
- [Diffusion Model](diffusion_model/)
    - Implementation of simple Diffusion Model.
- [GNN Mesh Classifier](graph_neural_networks/)
    - Learning about Graph Neural Networks by building mesh classifier with Torch Geometric.
- [Neural ODE for MNIST Classification](neural_ode_mnist_classification/)
    - Learning about Neural Ordinary Differential Equations by building simple MNIST Classifier using TorchDyn. 
- [WaveNet and Melody Generator](wavenet/)
    - Implementation of WaveNet architecture along with MIDI Melody Generator which was a project for my BEng thesis.
- [GPT](gpt/)
    - Implementation of GPT-1 to understand attention mechanism a little bit better.
- [Brain Tumor Classification](brain_tumor_classification/)
    - Brain Tumor Classification project using pretrained EfficientNetB4 as feature extractor and training classifier from scratch on top of it.
- [Hyena Operator](hyena_operator/)
    - Implementation of Hyena Operator for long range sequences. This paper really interested me and maybe I'll try to build a music generator in style of MusicLM but with this layer instead of self-attention blocks.
